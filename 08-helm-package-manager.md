# The Kubernetes package manager
[Enter Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) - the answer to how to package multi-container applications, and how to easily install packages on Kubernetes.

Helm helps you to:

- Achieve a simple (one command) and repeatable deployment
- Manage application dependency, using specific versions of other application and services
- Manage multiple deployment configurations: test, staging, production and others
- Execute post/pre deployment jobs during application deployment
- Update/rollback and test application deployments

## Installing

Install the Helm client ([Linux](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.7.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz), [Linux 32-bit](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.7.0-linux-386.tar.gz), [Windows](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.7.0-windows-amd64.tar.gz),[OSX](https://kubernetes-helm.storage.googleapis.com/helm-v2.7.0-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)) and let's play with it!

To setup the Helm server on your targeted cluster, run: 
```
helm init
```

This will install a tiller server in the Kubernetes cluster, which Helm uses to fetch and unpack resources in the cluster.

Helm uses a packaging format called [Charts](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md).  A Chart is a collection of files that describe k8s resources.  

Charts can be simple, describing something like a standalone web server but they can also be more complex, for example, a chart that represents a full web application stack included web servers, databases, proxies, etc.

Instead of installing k8s resources manually via kubectl, we can use Helm to install pre-defined Charts faster, with less chance of typos or other operator errors.

When you install Helm, you are provided with a default repository of Charts from the [official Helm Chart Repository](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable).

This is a very dynamic list that always changes due to updates and new additions.  To keep Helm's local list updated with all these changes, we need to occasionally run the [repository update](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-repo-update) command.

To update Helm's local list of Charts, run:
```
helm repo update
```

Instead of figuring out which docker images to run manually, we will let helm find them. 
Let helm install MySql: 

```
helm install stable/mysql
```

This will output information about your newly deployed mysql setup similar to this: 

```
NAME:   invinvible-serval

invinvible-serval-mysql  10.0.0.25   <none>       3306/TCP  0s
```

Running ```helm ls``` will show all current deployments and ```helm delete <deployment name>``` (in above example helm delete invinvible-serval) will remove the service again. 

As said before Helm deals with the concept of [charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts) for its deployment logic. Stable/mysql was a chart, [found here](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mysql) that describes how helm should deploy it. It interpolates values into the deployment, which for mysql looks [like this](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/blob/master/stable/mysql/templates/deployment.yaml). 

The charts describe which values can be given for overwriting default behaviour, and there is an active community around it. 

Praqma also has [Helmsman](https://github.com/Praqma/Helmsman) which is another layer of abstraction on top of Helm, allowing it to be automated as code deployments.
